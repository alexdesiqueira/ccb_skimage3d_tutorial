# Introduction to scikit-image for 3D image analysis

* Support material for the tutorial _Introduction to scikit-image for 3D image analysis_ at the Computational Biology Skills Seminar.

This tutorial will introduce how to analyze three dimensional stacked and volumetric images in Python, mainly using scikit-image. Here we will study how to:
  * pre-process data using filtering, binarization and segmentation techniques.
  * inspect, count and measure attributes of objects and regions of interest in the data.
  * visualize large 3D data.
